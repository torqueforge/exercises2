# Here's a reminder of the original goals for the prior refactoring:
#
      # 1) The Bowling class pretends that its job is to calculate a score, but
      #    most of the logic is concerned with turning a list of rolls into
      #    a list of (virtual) 'frames', for which it then sums scores.
      #
      #    I wish Bowling was better named, and more honest.
      #
      # 2) The Rules class uses a config to select a 'rule'.  This 'rule'
      #    is used by the badly named Bowling class as if it defines a 'frame',
      #    which Bowling knows how to score.
      #
      #    I wish Frame was a real thing which calculated it's own score.
      #
      # 3) The structure of the rules has leaked all over.  For example,
      #    Rules#scoring_rule and Bowling#score both have multiple references
      #    to keys in the hash.
      #
      #    I'd like the structure of the hash to be known in only one place.
#
# Those goals have been achieved.
#   Bowling has been replaced by Frames
#   Frame exists, and responds to #score
#   Variant is the sole owner of knowledge of a rules hash
#
# So far, so good, but are we any closer to being able to implement LOWBALL?
#
# Let's ask that question a different way.
#
# Have we increased the isolation of the things that need to vary? Or,
# are we at least beginning to understand the things that need to vary?
#
# Some things _are_ better.
# For example, if each Frame object returned the right #score for a LOWBALL game,
#   Frames would just work.
# Also, if Variant constructed a Frame with the _value_ of the roll, rather than
#   the _pinfall_ of the roll, Frame would just work.
#
# Perhaps Variant should be smarter about how it builds Frame objects.
