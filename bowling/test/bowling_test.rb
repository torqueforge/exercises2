  # Add Frames tests for yet another variant (LOWBALL). This is further pavement.
  #
  # However, now that we have parsers everything is about to become simpler.
  # These integration-y tests will become _unit_ tests on the parsers.
  #
  # FYI, the LowBallParser that's checked in with this commit CONTAINS A BUG
  # but still passes these two tests.  That bug will be caught later, when
  # unit tests get written.
  #
  # Two questions:
  # 1) Would that bug exist if the LowballRollParser had been TDD'd rather then covered
  #      with these integration tests?
  # 2) The LowballParser was written during an exploratory spike, using the very light
  #      coverage of these integration tests.  Did spiking make it easier or harder to
  #      arrive at an understanding of how the parser should be written?
