## Bowling Kata


### Goals:

* Become familiar with the Bowling Problem
* Practice writing just enough code to pass the tests
* Remind yourself of Shameless Green


### Task:

In this task you'll calculate the score for the list of bowling rolls.

The tests are already written and are in bowling/test/bowling_test.rb.

Run the tests by

    > cd root_directory_of_repo 

and then

    > ruby bowling/test/bowling_test.rb

  or  

    > rerun -x ruby bowling/test/bowling_test.rb


### Details:

The bowling kata was popularized by Robert Martin as an exercise in TDD (see bowling/BowlingGameKata.pdf).  When Martin does the kata, he does up front
design.  When _you_ do the kata, try to avoid design and just write
Shameless Green.

The bowling_test.rb contains *10* tests.  The first 5 are duplicates of Martin's.  The next 5 are our own additions.

Your job is to write code to make the tests.  Strive for Shameless Green.

Don't be alarmed if you don't get every test to passing in the time given, just concentrate on restraining yourself from doing a bunch of up-front design.

See branch bowling_1_tenpin_refactor for a step-by-step example.
