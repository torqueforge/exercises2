## Lowball


### Goals:

* Practice drawing class diagrams as an aid towards understand code
* Practice drawing sequence diagrams as a way to expore potential designs
* Start insisting that condition complexity live in only in *Factories*


### Task:

* See bowling/lib/bowling.rb for a description of the Lowball requirements, and a preliminary design discussion.

* Draw a class diagram of the existing code, and at least one sequence diagram of your tentative design.

* Once your goup has a clear, common visual image of what you'd like to achieve, have at it and write some code.

See branch bowling_l4_lowball_refactor for the step-by-step example.
